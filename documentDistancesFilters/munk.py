# Kuhn-Munkres, The hungarian algorithm.  Complexity O(n^3)
# Computes a max weight perfect matching in a bipartite graph
# for min weight matching, simply negate the weights.

""" Global variables:
       n = number of vertices on each side
       U,V vertex sets
       lu,lv are the labels of U and V resp.
       the matching is encoded as 
       - a mapping Mu from U to V, 
       - and Mv from V to U.
    
    The algorithm repeatedly builds an alternating tree, rooted in a
    free vertex u0. S is the set of vertices in U covered by the tree.
    For every vertex v, T[v] is the parent in the tree and Mv[v] the
    child.

    The algorithm maintains minSlack, s.t. for every vertex v not in
    T, minSlack[v]=(val,u1), where val is the minimum slack
    lu[u]+lv[v]-w[u][v] over u in S, and u1 is the vertex that
    realizes this minimum.

    Complexity is O(n^3), because there are n iterations in
    maxWeightMatching, and each call to augment costs O(n^2). This is
    because augment() makes at most n iterations itself, and each
    updating of minSlack costs O(n).
